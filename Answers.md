Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:

What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?

    Accessing an array, adding or removing from the back or front is O(1), because you know the index and is very fast. 
    If you have to search for a value, then it becomes O(N) and takes more time.

What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?

    The worst case would be O(N) because that mean you would have to move every single element in dyanmic array.

Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?

    A blockchain is a record of data that uses some type of "proof of work" to access the data and verify that it is true.
    Blockchain is also public so the data can be verified on its ledger. 
    The chain in the block chain, refers to the hashing of the "previous block" that is REQUIRED to access the next block in the chain.

Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?

    Proof of work is a process that takes a massive amount of computing power and time. 
    Once the proof of work is generated, it is easy to verify.
    This hinders an attack because no single computer, or even systems of computers would be able to override the overall power of all other miners on the chain.
    This makes it difficult for anyone to alter the chain.
